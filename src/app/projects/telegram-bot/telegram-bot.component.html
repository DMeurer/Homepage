<h1>Telegram bot</h1>
<p>
	This is a learning project and is a combination of multiple things I wanted to try
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing a Chatbot</li>
	<li>Containerizing a something (this was pre-university, so I din't know anything about it.</li>
	<li>Writing my own DevOps pipeline</li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing a Chatbot</h2>

<p>
	The first thing to consider is what platform to use.
	My first Ideas were Discord and WhatsApp, but Discord wont send push notifications on time, and for WhatsApp,
	it's super hard / costly to get a bot account since this is made for businesses.<br>
	Some research later I had a Telegram account and was chatting BotFather.
</p>
<p>
	A quick look at what languages have libraries for the Telegram Bot API and I chose my weapon for this project: Go.
</p>

<p>
	The bot itself is rather simple. It can echo, and print help messages like normal.
	Additionally it can print some debug information like the current time and the uptime of the bot and the server.<br>
	Some time later I added some more functionality some using external APIs or web scraping.<br>
	The first was a ping. This was a simple method of checking if a device in my home network is on, as long as I have the IP address.<br>
	The second was a IP Lookup. Also very simple, using a free API to get the location of an IP address.<br>
	The third can send you this week's canteen menu from my university, which is a simple web scraping task.
	You can choose if you want the full week or a single day, or get the current day by default.<br>
</p>

<h2>Containerizing a something</h2>
<p>
	Not having worked with containerization before, this was quite a challenge to figure out.<br>
	Starting with the GO example and some documentation, I got it running eventually.<br>
	Using a docker compose file, I've got a working zero-downtime deployment.
</p>

<h2>Writing my own DevOps pipeline</h2>

<p>
	This was kind of my main goal.<br>
	A solution that "just works" and is free and easy to use. My choice was Bash (and cron).<br>
	<br>
